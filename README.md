# GLCD-HQ
Gaussian sampling based on Localized Cumulative Distribution (LCD) and Cram√©r-von-Mises distance.
High quality (and slow) sampling procedure, does NOT use the simplification for standard normal distributions
(which is faster but gives inferior non-standard normally distributed samples).

Theorem III.2 from paper and code differ; version from the code gives "nice" Gaussian samples.

## Possible Improvements
- Find appropriate parameters (bmin, bmax, reltol of quadrature and optimizer) with respect to dimension, #samples, and standard deviations
- Julia: implement analytic gradients (currently: ForwardDiff)

## Example
Two-dimensional Gaussian density with standard deviations 0.5 and 1, approximated with 30 samples:
